Creating your own types
Who doesn't want to create your own types
1. First you can define an abstract type using the keyword abstract
  ex. abstract dog
2. Or you can define it as a certian type (under specific supertypes)
  ex. Define another type as the type Number
  ex. abstract dog2 <: Number
3. Can create concrete types
  ex. ConcreteDog <: dog (is of type dog)
        name::String
        collarId::Int (specifies the type)
      end
4. Can instatntiate
  ex. Woofer = ConcreteDog("Heavy", 4321)
5. Can access these fields with dot notation
  ex. Woofer.name will return "Heavy"
